# prison-grid

This is a simple DrawBot script that creates a grid simulating pink gratings — something I'll use for a poster propostal for ONHB’s 11th edition.

It uses Perlin noise to change the size and position in each cell, making the transitions nice and soft.

It should work with any paper size.

# Modes
Although my idea is to only use mode = 3, there are two other output options:

## mode = 1
![Output when mode equals 1](output/mode_1.png?raw=true "mode = 1")

## mode = 2
![Output when mode equals 2](output/mode_2.png?raw=true "mode = 2")

## mode = 3
![Output when mode equals 3](output/mode_3.png?raw=true "mode = 3")
